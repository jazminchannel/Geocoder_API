# Geocoder_API
In this project, I imported the [geocoder](https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/providers/ArcGIS.html#geocoding) module, and used it to translate destinations into latitude-longitude coordinates.

For security purposes I have removed the API Key from my code and replaced it with "XXXXXXX".
